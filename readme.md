-- If you are using the Register customer function, DO NOT put valid credit card numbers into the database! I promise I won't steal anything, but do you want to put your faith in some random Github user? --

How to use application:
* Download using git clone statement above.
* cd into directory containing root of app, in this case, cd into webframeworks.
* run `npm install` in terminal.
* run `npm start` OR `node_modules\.bin\nodemon` for windows terminals, `node_modules/.bin/nodemon` for linux-based terminals.
* Change browsers web address to [This Link](http://localhost:3000/about)
* Use the links to visit each page.

The only working database functions are the GET request for the Game Page and the POST function for storing customer details into the database.
  

# TODO: 
* Solve Database not returning anything. (Kind of Done!)
* Add Angular Component 
* Add Passport.js

*Very Italic Statement*

**Very Bold Statement**

`
public class whatever{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
